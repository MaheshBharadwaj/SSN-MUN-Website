                A model United Nations Conference is an educational simulation and/or academic competition in which students play the role of delegates representing various countries/organizations. The delegates carefully dissect and deliberate over world issues while adhering to their respective country’s policies in order for young citizens to improve their leadership skills while learning about diplomacy, international relations, major world issues and the United Nations.

                We were also the first MUN in the country to introduce a revolutionary new e-chit system, one that has been adopted by other MUNs around the country ever since. This year is no different. We are committed to making the MUN bigger and better than ever before and we cordially invite you to join us in this endeavour.
            </p>
            <p>

                This year’s MUN, albeit online, will aim to have a greater outreach than ever before, transcending issues of physical accessibility and making a wider demographic participate in SSNMUN 2022.
